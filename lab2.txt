+CS452/EE465 Computer Graphics Spring 2015
+Lab #2
+
+due: Tuesday, 2/17/15 at midnight
+
+Write a WebGL application that will move a 2D shape using the ASDW and 1 keys.
+
+Create an interesting (but simple) 2D shape (avatar) that uses at least three different colors. Move the avatar
+on the canvas using ASDW (a - move left; s - move down; d - move right; w - move up). Also, hitting the "1" key will
+move the avatar back to the origin. You may continue to work in the default space (-1.0 to +1.0).
+
+Assumptions:
+1. vertex coordinates will be in the range [-1.0, +1.0]
+2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel
+3. three files are required in the solution: lab2.html, lab2.js and lab2.README.txt. The lab1.README.txt file
+will contain your name and date along with a brief description of your solution. Note, however, that all
+files should contain a comment including your name and date.
+
+Challenges: (entirely optional, but fun)
+1. prevent the avatar from moving out of the view space
+2. add some other non-moving shapes, but you don't need to use collision detection (yet).
